## About
AIParkinScan (AIPS) is an artifical intelligence software used for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. It asks for the input of a drawing, which is evaluated for inconsistency that is caused by micrographia. If inconsistency is detected, it is a strong indication of Parkinson's, as micrographia is a common symptom of Parkinson's.

Our aim is to develop an easy, accurate, and efficent way to diagnose Parkinson's disease. There are currently limited and unoffical tests for Parkinson's, and even after diagnosis, symptoms need to be carefully monitored. Using our software, diagnosis of Parkinson's becomes widely available to all.
